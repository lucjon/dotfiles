h1. molly.vim

p. ZOMG! Very fast and sexy textmate-like command-t plugin. It also works for regular vim. By default it caches the filelist, so if you add a new file you have to call the `RefreshFileList` function.

h2. Dependencies

p. The only hard dependency `molly` needs is the unix `find` command.

h2. Getting Started

p. By default it uses `Leader Key + x` but you can change it to whatever you want.

p. Currently is uses the vim default regex to parse the results, an example query would be: "users.*_test"

h2. Mappings

* Leader + x  -  open molly
* Enter       -  go to file
* Ctrl + v    -  open in a vertical split window
* Ctrl + s    -  open in a split window
